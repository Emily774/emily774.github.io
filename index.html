			<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p></p>
					<section> An ambitious and creative team player with broad international experience. Having completed iO Academy's Full Stack Developer Bootcamp, I am eager to exercise my new skills as a member of a Full-Stack development team.
						My studies in the UK, USA, Switzerland and Spain, led me to complete the International Baccalaureate with Honors, followed by a Kitchener Memorial Fund Scholarship to study for an International Relations degree at Buckingham University. When my degree studies were suspended for medical reasons, I commenced a coding course with Khan Academy and found the field fascinating. The iO Academy course has now reinforced my determination to work as a developer in this important and fast-changing sphere.
						In my spare time I indulge in such diverse activities as windsurfing, fencing, reading and piano playing. I have a certificate in Windsurfing, won a competition at Charter House for fencing, worked as an editor for a New York Children’s book publisher and have taught myself up to Grade 5 in piano playing over the course of the last two years, though I have yet to take the test for it. I am also a qualified PADI scuba diver which has enabled me to explore some of the over 2,000 shipwrecks off the Dorset coast. click on the images below to see some of my sample projects.

			<h2>My Projects</h2>
				<h4>Times Lord Collectables</h4>
						<h5>February 2021</h5>
					<section>Doctor Who is an iconic character who has fascinated generations of viewers. I designed a personalised website populated with existing 'TimeLord Characters' from the popular BBC sci-fi show. Character profiles are pulled from an SQL database using PHP and users can use a post request to add their own generic Time Lords to the database using the form at the bottom of the page. The new characters are then displayed on the main webpage.<br>

				<h4>Memory Game</h4>
					<h5>February 2021</h5>
				<section>This fun memory game enables you to virtually match pairs of home-drawn hamster cards! A team project, this game was built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I focused on creating event handlers to ensure that the cards responded appropriately to being selected. No more than two cards can be selected at any one time and they flip back over after a designated period.<br>

				<h4>Biscuit App</h4>
					<h5>March 2021</h5>
				<section>Another PHP project,  we created a biscuit webpage designed to pull information about biscuits from the SQL database and provide a website display. All methods were unit tested and all Classes formatted according to SOLID principles. We created detailed wireframes to be approved by our Product Owner, in this case one of our tutors, and proceeded according to DRY principals.<br>

				<h4>Rebranding a Website</h4>
					<h5>March 2021</h5>
				<section>Instead of creating a new project, my scrum team and I worked on a legacy project in order to change the layout of this website and remove potential bugs. We used primarily Typescript and Sass with a gulp compiler.

				<h4>Bug Fixes on Legacy Website</h4>
					<h5>April 2021</h5>
				<section>Working as Scrum Master on this legacy project, my team and I worked in a Slim Design framework using mVC to build on and modify an existing Applicant Management Webpage for the academy. <br>
